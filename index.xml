Welcome to my latest attempt to write something meaningful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a backend engineer and primarily work on distributed systems. This blog is going to the place where I publish my learnings, findings as an engineer, and stuff I find interesting in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been working with Kubernetes and Go in general, with a mix of JavaScript. I assume I would write about them first, but who knows - &lt;strong>TBD!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A little about this blog&amp;rsquo;s existence. It has been up for some time now with zero content and lots of unnecessary AWS magic to support it. With Github pages, I am hoping to stop maintaining the site itself and finally do some writing. Letâ€™s see how this goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s to all the optimism 2022 brings and a covid-free future ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On to &lt;strong>Blog Post #1&lt;/strong> now.&lt;/p>
