Welcome to my latest attempt to write something meaningful.
I am a backend engineer and primarily work on distributed systems. This blog is going to the place where I publish my learnings, findings as an engineer, and stuff I find interesting in general.
I have been working with Kubernetes and Go in general, with a mix of JavaScript. I assume I would write about them first, but who knows - TBD!</description></item></channel></rss>
